# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Found out about the challenge, getting ready to publicly take on this challenge! I aim to get my JavaScript certification on FCC, learn PHP as well as Python during this challenge. 

**Thoughts:**  I wrote a blog post regarding my purpose and thoughts coming into this challenge, feeling excited!

### Day 1 : Nov 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up FCC's Basic Data Structure curriculum. Will be moving on to Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts**: Feeling satisfied with the work I had completed today. Didn't have much issues since I actually completed the Object Oriented Programming curriculum before this.


### Day 2: Nov 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first half of the Basic Algorithm curriculum. I had some difficulties here and there, and even had my own variation of code for some of the challenges! I clarified them on the forum and learnt a lot more. Also, I decided to visit a query that I had since 3 days ago regarding Regex positive and negative lookaheads and I'm really glad I did so because I finally answered the doubt I had in my head. 

**Thoughts** Overall, feeling really satisfied with the amount of work I had put in today, but I think more could have been achieved. The exercises for Basic Algorithm Scripting also helped me to realize that I had progressed a lot farther since the start of my coding journey than I thought I did.


### Day 3: Nov 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a few of the challenges for Basic Algorithm Scripting. I'm not done, because I spent the day trying my hands on some JavaScript projects! I built a simple tip calculator, a random hex color code generator as well as a quote generator with a bit of help from a Youtube video. I feel like learning through projects is much better as you get to practice and see how the different attributes come into play. I really enjoy it. My next goal is to build a to-do list with JavaScript. However, I will only be doing it after completing more of FCC's JavaScript curriculum so I am closer to getting my certification. Also, I would like to add learning GitHub to one of my goals (i'm terrible).

**Thoughts** I loved spending time coding out my projects. It's much more rewarding to see your code work and spend time improving my debugging skills. This trained my patience as well as significantly deepened my understanding of JavaScript arrays, events, and linking html elements with the scripts. Today was really productive.

### Day 16: Nov 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I finally learnt how to clone GitHub repositories and work on them on VSCode (which is probably why I started to log my prorgess from today HAHAHA, I'll backtrack and log my progress from other days too). Needless to say, I'm extremely excited and happy that I finally figured it out (it was so simple, how did I not figure this out earlier?!). I also decided to start on JavaScript30 and completed up till Day 4's projects. Tomorrow, I will be starting from Day 5. 

**Thoughts** The past few days, I was going through some pretty difficult times in terms of finding the motivation and focus to learn one thing at a time. School had been pretty stressful and doesn't teach much that needs to be known before we can start on projects, which is why I had to pick up Python on my own. It's not that I dislike learning, in fact I LOVE LOVE Python! So I do not mind learning. But what I found out is that I have to learn to accept the fact that school and education is not going to wait for you to catch up. It is going to be brutal, especially when I am the kind of person that loves to start from 0 and work my way up to master. It's going to require a lot of my extra time (which I have been giving consistently for the past 50 days or more), and it's not going to be very rewarding (unfortunate). But in the end, this will affect my future. My grades do not determine how good of a programmer I am - the projects I come up with do. I know that with this mentality, I will be able to progress on forward without allowing anything to skew my trajectory.

### Day 18: Nov 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I managed to accomplish my goal that I stated on Twitter which is to finish JS30 up till day 8's content. I had learnt a lot and had my first experience with HTML canvas! It's fun, but I would like to learn more. I have also started spending more time watching code challenges and I noticed that many of them made use of the HTML canvas, which peaked my interest. In the future, after getting better in JavaScript and CSS (i'm fine with CSS, but there's actually so much depth to it and i want to cover more in order to push out more awesome looking websites), I would probably be spending my time learning about HTML canvas. 

**Thoughts** I really improved, I can feel it. I've been constantly writing down the things I have learnt and trying to be conscious of areas I have improved in. One of the things I know I am getting better at would be writing arrow functions. Before this challenge, I would probably have never touched it. But after I was introduced to how it works and how much it simplifies the code, I tried to implement it, even trying to finish the function before the instructor does and boy, I got it right. Nothing beats this feeling. It's an invisible push - a driving force - that propels me forward. I am really grateful to have such wonderful resources and be surrounded by such a motivated and encouraging community of like-minded programmers.
