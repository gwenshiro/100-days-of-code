# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Found out about the challenge, getting ready to publicly take on this challenge! I aim to get my JavaScript certification on FCC, learn PHP as well as Python during this challenge. 

**Thoughts:**  I wrote a blog post regarding my purpose and thoughts coming into this challenge, feeling excited!

### Day 1 : Nov 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up FCC's Basic Data Structure curriculum. Will be moving on to Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts**: Feeling satisfied with the work I had completed today. Didn't have much issues since I actually completed the Object Oriented Programming curriculum before this.

### Day 2: Nov 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first half of the Basic Algorithm curriculum. I had some difficulties here and there, and even had my own variation of code for some of the challenges! I clarified them on the forum and learnt a lot more. Also, I decided to visit a query that I had since 3 days ago regarding Regex positive and negative lookaheads and I'm really glad I did so because I finally answered the doubt I had in my head. 

**Thoughts** Overall, feeling really satisfied with the amount of work I had put in today, but I think more could have been achieved. The exercises for Basic Algorithm Scripting also helped me to realize that I had progressed a lot farther since the start of my coding journey than I thought I did.
