# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Nov 1, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Found out about the challenge, getting ready to publicly take on this challenge! I aim to get my JavaScript certification on FCC, learn PHP as well as Python during this challenge. 

**Thoughts:**  I wrote a blog post regarding my purpose and thoughts coming into this challenge, feeling excited!

### Day 1 : Nov 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up FCC's Basic Data Structure curriculum. Will be moving on to Basic Algorithm Scripting.

**Thoughts**: Feeling satisfied with the work I had completed today. Didn't have much issues since I actually completed the Object Oriented Programming curriculum before this.


### Day 2: Nov 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the first half of the Basic Algorithm curriculum. I had some difficulties here and there, and even had my own variation of code for some of the challenges! I clarified them on the forum and learnt a lot more. Also, I decided to visit a query that I had since 3 days ago regarding Regex positive and negative lookaheads and I'm really glad I did so because I finally answered the doubt I had in my head. 

**Thoughts** Overall, feeling really satisfied with the amount of work I had put in today, but I think more could have been achieved. The exercises for Basic Algorithm Scripting also helped me to realize that I had progressed a lot farther since the start of my coding journey than I thought I did.


### Day 3: Nov 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I did a few of the challenges for Basic Algorithm Scripting. I'm not done, because I spent the day trying my hands on some JavaScript projects! I built a simple tip calculator, a random hex color code generator as well as a quote generator with a bit of help from a Youtube video. I feel like learning through projects is much better as you get to practice and see how the different attributes come into play. I really enjoy it. My next goal is to build a to-do list with JavaScript. However, I will only be doing it after completing more of FCC's JavaScript curriculum so I am closer to getting my certification. Also, I would like to add learning GitHub to one of my goals (i'm terrible).

**Thoughts** I loved spending time coding out my projects. It's much more rewarding to see your code work and spend time improving my debugging skills. This trained my patience as well as significantly deepened my understanding of JavaScript arrays, events, and linking html elements with the scripts. Today was really productive.
